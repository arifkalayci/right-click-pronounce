This is a simple Chrome extension, which integrates into the context menu.

When context menu is popped up while some text is selected, a menu item named "Pronounce this word" will appear. Clicking this item will make the word pronounced.

**Note**: If the word is in an inflected form, the uninflected form will be pronounced.
